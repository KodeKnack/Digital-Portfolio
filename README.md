📁 6. Business Communication

Evidence
	•	Client email: sprint scope clarification (PDF)
	•	Stand-up notes / Sprint summary (PNG/PDF)
	•	UI handover checklist to QA (MD/PDF)
	•	Slide: “React Native release notes – Expo 53” (PDF)

STAR Reflection

S – Situation:
During my internship at Plum Systems, we had a compressed sprint to release a React Native feature built with Expo. Misunderstandings about scope caused rework and risk to the release.

T – Task:
Clarify scope, align stakeholders (PM, backend, QA), and communicate a single source of truth to reduce churn.

A – Action:
I drafted a concise scope clarification email summarising user stories, acceptance criteria, and API assumptions. I attached a handover checklist (linting, ESLint/Prettier status, Expo build notes, and test cases) and presented a short slide during stand-up to confirm roles and timelines.

R – Result:
We reduced back-and-forth messages by ~40% (measured over Slack threads), QA passed on the first round for two UI tickets, and the release shipped on time. I adopted the same email/checklist template for future sprints.

📁 7. Interview Skills

Evidence
	•	CV v2 with tracked changes (PDF)
	•	Cover letter tailored to Front-End role (PDF)
	•	Answer bank: React, REST, Firebase, State management (MD)
	•	60–90s elevator pitch script (MD)

STAR Reflection

S – Situation:
I needed to improve my interview performance for junior Front-End/React roles, especially around state management and API integration.

T – Task:
Develop concise, structured answers and a clear elevator pitch aligned to React/React Native, Expo, Redux/Context, REST, and Firebase auth/RTDB.

A – Action:
I created an answer bank using the STAR pattern, rehearsed a 75-second pitch (present-past-future), and recorded two practice sessions. I updated my CV to highlight concrete outcomes (e.g., UI responsiveness, DX improvements with ESLint/Prettier).

R – Result:
Mock ratings improved from 6/10 to 8.5/10 for “clarity” and “technical depth.” I can now explain Redux vs Context trade-offs and API error handling with practical examples from Plum Systems.

⸻

📁 8. Mock Interview

Evidence
	•	Mock interview recording (MP4)
	•	Rubric/score sheet (PNG/PDF)
	•	Self-critique & improvement plan (MD)

STAR Reflection

S – Situation:
In a recorded mock interview for a React/React Native role, I struggled to frame trade-off decisions (e.g., Redux vs Context + useReducer).

T – Task:
Demonstrate structured problem-solving and articulate architectural decisions with examples.

A – Action:
I reviewed the recording and timestamped weak answers. I rewrote responses to:
	•	Explain when Redux is ideal (complex global state, predictable flows, middleware).
	•	Explain when Context/useReducer is enough (lightweight, localised state).
I added a concrete example from integrating a Firebase-backed notifications panel and an Expo build pipeline consideration.

R – Result:
Second mock improved from 65% → 85%. Feedback commended “clear trade-off reasoning” and “linking answers to real project scenarios.”

📁 9. Professional Networking

Evidence
	•	LinkedIn profile PDF export (PDF)
	•	Outreach messages to React/Expo engineers (MD with screenshots)
	•	Informational interview notes (MD)

STAR Reflection

S – Situation:
I wanted guidance on Expo 53, CI/CD, and Firebase Cloud Functions to speed up debugging and builds at Plum Systems.

T – Task:
Grow a relevant network and secure at least two informational interviews with React/Expo engineers.

A – Action:
I optimised my LinkedIn headline (“Front-End/React & React Native – Expo | Firebase | REST”), posted a short project highlight with GIFs, and sent targeted outreach (3-line message + clear ask). I prepared 6 focused questions (CI/CD choices, EAS, Over-the-Air updates, testing).

R – Result:
I secured 3 calls, received a sample EAS config, and learned a quicker release checklist. I implemented one suggestion (separate staging channel builds), which reduced my test feedback loop by ~25%.

📁 10. Workplace Etiquette

Evidence
	•	Team norms & code style doc (MD/PDF)
	•	Stand-up cadence + progress notes (PNG/PDF)
	•	PR template screenshot (PNG)

STAR Reflection

S – Situation:
Our team needed consistent etiquette for code collaboration—PR hygiene, commit messages, and meeting etiquette—while working hybrid.

T – Task:
Improve reliability and reduce friction in reviews and handovers.

A – Action:
I adopted the team’s PR template, wrote clear commit messages, responded to comments within 24 hours, and summarised daily progress in stand-up using a “Yesterday/Today/Risks” format. I also followed meeting etiquette (on-time join, agenda, actions).

R – Result:
PR turnaround time improved from ~3 days to <48 hours, and merge conflicts decreased on shared components. Feedback from my mentor highlighted “professional communication and preparedness.”

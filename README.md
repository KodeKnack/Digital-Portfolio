## 1. Troubleshooting & Debugging Frontend Issues

**S – Situation:**  
During my internship at Plum Systems, I frequently encountered issues when forking new branches in React frontend projects. These issues included dependency mismatches and rendering errors that blocked the app from launching correctly.

**T – Task:**  
Independently identify and fix these issues without slowing down the sprint or depending heavily on other team members.

**A – Action:**  
- Forked the branch and attempted to run the project locally.  
- Diagnosed mismatched or missing dependencies as the primary cause.  
- Used `yarn install` to align dependencies with the project configuration.  
- Debugged rendering issues by inspecting components, checking responsiveness, and using browser dev tools.  
- Fixed a specific validation issue where the enquiry form required a phone number even when an email was provided.  
- Thoroughly tested changes on multiple devices before pushing updates.

**R – Result:**  
I resolved issues quickly without blocking the development flow. This built my confidence in debugging React apps and maintaining reliable environments.

## 2. Communicating Technical Constraints to Stakeholders

**T – Task:**  
Clearly communicate the technical constraint and propose a practical solution that aligns with stakeholder needs.

**A – Action:**  
- Reviewed the validation logic to understand the restriction.  
- Explained the conflict between the existing setup and user expectations to the team lead.  
- Proposed a flexible validation rule allowing either a valid email or phone number.  
- Maintained communication through Git comments and team discussions before implementing.  
- Thoroughly tested the fix to ensure no regressions.

**R – Result:**  
The updated validation improved usability and aligned the product with stakeholder expectations, all without disrupting the UI framework. It also demonstrated my ability to translate technical issues into business-friendly solutions.
